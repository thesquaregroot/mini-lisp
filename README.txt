Building and Running
--------------------
  This project can be successfully build with 'gmake' and executed with './lisp < infile > outfile'.

Design Description
------------------
  This intepreter uses an object-oriented recursive descent structure.  The 'interpereter' class
receives a 'tokenizer' in its constructor and uses that to build 's_expression' objects.
